# Salary-Calculator

As I was doinbg some job searching awhile back, I noticed some inconsistencies in job postings regarding pay.

Some sites would have the annual salary listed, while others would have the hourly pay listed. 

I wanted to create a tool to help me determine if a job was even worth applying for.

This Python code is the result of said tool. 

When running the program, the following window will appear.

You can enter either the annual salary, click "Calculate Hourly Pay" and it will output the hourly pay at the bottom of the window.
You can also enter the hourly pay, click "Calculate Annual Salary" and it will output the annual salary at the bottom of the window.
